## Reflections

üåü Here are my reflections on what I learned in each module and how it contributes to the development of my skills:

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, and I can use the JavaScript skills I already have along with capabilities that weren't previously available to me.
The main feature of TypeScript is its type system. In TypeScript, I can determine the data type of a variable or parameter using a type hint. Type hints describe the shape of an object, which provides better documentation and allows TypeScript to check that my code is working correctly.
With static type checking, TypeScript identifies code problems early in development that JavaScript typically cannot detect until the code is running in the browser. Types also allow me to describe what my code is intended to do.
Record types can be optional in TypeScript because type inference allows me to get most of this functionality without writing any extra code. If TypeScript can determine the data type implicitly, it automatically determines the data type.

The main advantage of TypeScript is that it allows you to add static types to my JavaScript code. Types impose static constraints on program objects such as functions, variables, and properties, so that compilers and development tools can better test and help me in the development process.
The static type system at compile time allows me to accurately express type relationships. TypeScript type analysis is fully performed at compile time and does not increase program execution time.
Static types also allow for better documentation of the code, which helps me and other developers understand it.

One of the main benefits of TypeScript is interfaces, which are a powerful way to define the "code contract" within my code, as well as contracts with code outside of my project.

In JavaScript, function definitions do not specify the data types for parameters, do not check the type of arguments passed, or do not check the number of arguments received. Therefore, I have to add logic to check these parameters in my functions.
TypeScript simplifies the development of functions by allowing you to define the types of parameters and return values. TypeScript also allows you to choose whether to make parameters mandatory or optional.
Adding types to functions helps prevent passing values that should not be passed to their functions. Typed functions are especially important when I work with large code bases or functions developed by other users. Instead of adding all the logic to the function to make sure that the correct value type is passed to it and the returned value is correct, TypeScript helps me ensure the correct value types when developing code.

TypeScript allows you to declare and instantiate classes that express common object-oriented patterns in a standard way, making features like inheritance more readable and compatible.
A class encapsulates data for an object. Data and behavior are included in the class, but the details of both may be hidden from the developer who manipulates the object in code. A class serves as a black box where all attributes and behavior are accessible only through properties and methods, limiting what the programmer can do with it.

TypeScript also allows you to create a component that can work with different types, not just one, while maintaining the capabilities of the TypeScript type checking system.
I've learned that Generics are code templates that I can define and reuse in my code base, they provide a way to tell functions, classes, or interfaces which type I want to use when calling them.
Generics are a way to create generic functions when my code is a function or class that works with different data types and uses that data type in multiple places.

TypeScript modules provide a way to organize and categorize my code, allowing me to group related code together. Additionally, when code is inside a module, it is pulled out of the global scope and into the module's scope. This helps me avoid naming conflicts between components in the global namespace.

TypeScript namespaces are a TypeScript-specific way of organizing and categorizing my code, allowing me to group related code together.
The code inside the namespace is extracted from the global scope to the namespace scope. This arrangement helps me avoid naming conflicts between components in the global namespace.

üöÄ**In summary, I can say that TypeScript offers me all the features of JavaScript, plus an extra layer on top of them. Using TypeScript for JavaScript development helps me write more reliable code, reduces typing and runtime errors, and allows me to take advantage of modern features before they are available in JavaScript.**
